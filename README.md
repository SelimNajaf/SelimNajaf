### Hi there, I'm Selim! 👋

I am a **Data Scientist** with an **Engineering background**, specializing in predictive modeling, machine learning pipelines, and high-volume data processing. I bridge the gap between advanced analytics and business strategy—building scalable ML solutions while continuing to use code to uncover revenue leakage, operational inefficiencies, and platform failures.
